## Introduction

Pegasus X is an open-source project aimed at simplifying and accelerating the data analysis workflow. It provides a set of tools and functionalities that allow users to perform data analysis tasks without the need for extensive programming knowledge. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced data professional, Pegasus X offers a user-friendly interface for analyzing, visualizing, and modeling data.

## Features

- **Data Loading:** Load data from various sources, including CSV, Excel, databases, and APIs.
- **Data Cleaning:** Clean and preprocess data using built-in methods for handling missing values, duplicates, and outliers.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Perform EDA with just a few clicks to gain insights into your dataset's structure and distribution.
- **Visualization:** Create interactive visualizations such as scatter plots, histograms, and heatmaps to better understand your data.
- **Machine Learning:** Build and evaluate machine learning models using popular algorithms for classification, regression, and clustering.
- **Automated Reporting:** Generate detailed analysis reports with visualizations, statistics, and model evaluations.
- **Collaboration:** Share your analysis with colleagues by exporting your work to various formats or collaborating directly within the platform.
